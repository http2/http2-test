#http2-test [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/http2/http2-test.png)](https://travis-ci.org/http2/http2-test)

Test Suite for HTTP/2 protocol.

The tests are divided into client and server tests. 

#Installation

The tests are written in JavaScript and run in the [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) JavaScript runtime
environment. As a first step, [download](http://nodejs.org/download/) and install node.js.

The test runner has several dependencies. These can be installed with `npm` (the Node Package
Manager, part of every node.js installation), with the following command issued in the root
directory of your clone of this git repo:

```bash
$ npm install
```

You'll also need `grunt-cli`:

```bash
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
```

#Usage

## Testing the client

After installing the dependencies, as described above, set the envrinoment variable HTTP2_BROWSER to the client executable. Note that the client should be able to parse a URL in its command line. Then run 

```bash
$ grunt mochaTest:client
```

To try out the tests, a sample browser is included. This is picked up if the HTTP2_BROWSER environment variable does not exist. Note that currently, the client is expected to directly connect with the HTTP2 protocol and no upgrade is used. ALPN as a negotiation will be added soon. 

## Testing the server

After installing the dependencies as described above, run

```bash
$ grunt mochaTest:server
```

Currently the tests are run against a sample server. To test against a custom server, edit lib/server/index.js to include the appropriate IP and port. The support for setting this through environment variables will be added.

There are additional server tests in the `server-tests` branch. This branch also includes a modified node-http2 module to allow non-compliant protocol behavior for testing purposes. The client tests in this branch haven't yet been updated to work with the modified http2 module.


#Adding Tests

## Server tests
For server tests, create new tests as the `./lib/tests/*-test.js` directory. Look at the template-test.js for an example
